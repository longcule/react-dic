<h1>Hi Iâ€™m Selman ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my  Countries Table Component.  </h1>

<br>

<p>The purpose of this project is to pull the information of all countries from the https://restcountries.com/v2/all  API link with axios and show them in the table created with bootstrap. There are 2 search inputs. The first is the part where we find the relevant country by typing any information about the countries. the second is the part where we show the country list according to the names of the capitals.</p>
